<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
	Hello everybody. My name is Ihor, I am 34 years old. I am married, I have a son, he recently turned 10 years old.
	Briefly about my hobbies, I really like to learn something new, to become competent in many things. Now I am studying
	WEB development, as I want to acquire a new specialty and move with my family to Canada for permanent residence.
